REFLECTION?
This generator was fairly simple to create with a bit of preparation prior to starting. I started off with creating pseudocode
and went from there. I ran into a major problem this time around, having my new files overwritten by my old files whenever 
I connected my flash drive to my laptop at home. This became unbearable after coding for two hours and having all my progress 
erased. I made two permanent changes to my setup: I have switched from using BlueJ to using Sublime Text 3. The minimal design 
and ability to customize the software makes me enjoy coding more. I have also started utilizing GitHub for version control.
Most often I will continue to make several changes to my code and then hit a roadblock. When I try to backtrack, I forget what
the code originally said and which parts worked and which ones didn't. GitHub allows me to see the changes I make with every save
and also acts as shared storage between the school computer and my computer at home. 

As far as the actual generator goes, the only difficulty I faced was attempting to work with exceptions. I decided to learn 
about catching exceptions later because I focused way too much on it at the beginning, causing me to waste time. I'll be sure
to meet all the requirements before delving into the cherries on top.
